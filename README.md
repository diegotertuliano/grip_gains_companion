# Grip Gains Unofficial Companion

An unofficial iOS companion app for [gripgains.ca](https://gripgains.ca/) that adds quality-of-life features.

## Features

- **Keep screen awake** - Screen stays on during your training session
- **Auto-click fail button** - When connected to a Tindeq Progressor, automatically clicks the fail button when your grip fails
- **Measure actual weight** - Verify your load with the Tindeq before inputting on the website (ensures consistency when switching setups or using cable machines where indicated weight may differ from actual load)
- **Target weight feedback** - Set a target weight and get visual, audio, and haptic feedback when you reach it
- **Real-time force graph** - Visualize your grip force over time with a live chart

## Requirements
